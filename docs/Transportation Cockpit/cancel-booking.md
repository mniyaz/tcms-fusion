## 🧭 Steps to Cancel a Booking

### 1. 📂 Navigate to the Transportation Cockpit Module

### 4. 💬 Cancellation Pop-up Box

**-Chargeable**

By default, the non-chargeable tab will be selected.

## 🟢 Non-Chargeable Cancellation (Default Option)

### 6. ✅ Confirm Cancellation

-After entering the remarks, click the **CONFIRM** button to proceed with the cancellation.

### 7. 📁 Booking Status Update

-The booking will be cancelled and will move to the **SUMMARY** tab.
-It will not proceed to the **INVOICING** module since no charges apply.

## 💸 Chargeable Cancellation (If Applicable)

### 8. 🔄 Switch to the Chargeable Tab

-If the cancellation is **chargeable**, switch to the Chargeable tab within the cancellation pop-up.

### 9. 💵 Enter Cancellation Amount and Remarks

-In the Chargeable tab, enter the **cancellation amount** to be charged to the customer.

### 10. ✅ Confirm Chargeable Cancellation

-Once the cancellation amount and remarks are entered, click the **CONFIRM** button.

### 11. 📁 Booking Status Update

-The booking will be cancelled and moved to the **SUMMARY** tab.

-The booking will then proceed to the **INVOICING** module where an invoice will be generated for the customer to cover the cancellation charges.

## 🗒️ Additional Information

**Booking Movement:** After a booking is cancelled, it will always move to the **SUMMARY** tab, either without invoicing (for non-chargeable cancellations) or with invoicing (for chargeable cancellations).

**Cancellation Options:** Only bookings that are marked as **"Chargeable"** can have an associated cancellation fee; non-chargeable bookings are typically not subject to any fees.
