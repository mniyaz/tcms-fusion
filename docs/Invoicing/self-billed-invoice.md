# Self-Billed E-Invoice

This guide explains how to prepare and issue a **self-billed e-invoice** using **TCMS**.

---
1. Navigate to **HR → Customer** and open the customer that requires a self-billed invoice.

2. In the customer details screen, enable the **Self-Billed Invoice** option by ticking the checkbox.

3. From the **Currency** dropdown, select the appropriate currency for the customer, then click **Save**.

4. Under **Invoicing**, generate the invoice for this customer following the standard process.

5. Once submitted to the e-invoice portal, the self-billed invoice will be created using the selected currency, with the customer recorded as the supplier and your company as the buyer.

6. Similarly, self-billed **credit or debit notes** also work using the same process.
