# E-Invoice Integration

This guide explains how to integrate **TCMS** with the **Malaysian LHDN e-Invoice Portal**.

---

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Settings → Invoicing** and enable **E-Invoicing Integration**.

2. Enter the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, **TIN Number**, and select the **e-Invoice ID Type & Value** as registered with LHDN.

	## How to Obtain Client ID & Client Secret (MyInvois Portal)
				
	 * **Log In** – Sign in to the MyInvois Portal using your Malaysian TIN.  
	 * **View Profile** – Open **View Taxpayer Profile** from the top-right profile menu.  
	 * **ERP Setup** – Navigate to the **ERP** section (or *Representatives*) and click **Register / Edit**.  
	 * **ERP Details** – Enter the ERP name, secret expiry period, and set it as the **Primary System**.  
     * **Generate Credentials** – Save the configuration to generate the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

3. Choose the **e-Invoice Portal** environment (**Staging** or **Production**).

4. Enable **Use Current Date for E-Invoice Date** to submit the e-invoice using the current date instead of the invoice date.

5. Click **Save** to complete the configuration.

**Note:** Once saved, you can enable the **E-Invoice** checkbox to submit invoices immediately during invoice, credit note, or debit note generation, or submit them later from the generated table.
