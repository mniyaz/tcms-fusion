### ✅ Step 1: Place Booking and Assign Vendor Truck & Driver

-Place a **booking** in the system.

-Assign the **vendor’s truck and driver** to the booking.

-Once assigned, a **POD Upload link** will be automatically sent to the vendor driver via **WhatsApp**.

### 📲 Step 2: Access the POD Upload Link via WhatsApp

-The vendor driver opens the WhatsApp message and taps the **POD Upload link**.

-An OTP (One-Time Password) will be sent to the **driver’s WhatsApp** to verify access.

-Enter the **OTP** on the Verification Page.

-After successful verification, the driver will be redirected to the **Document Upload** Page.

**🔐 Note:** The **OTP** is valid for a limited time. If it expires, the driver can request a new one by reopening the link.

### 📤 Step 3: Upload the POD Document

-Confirm the **Customer Name** and Delivery Order (DO) Number.

-If the DO number is missing, enter it **manually**.

-Set the Delivery Status to **DELIVERED**.

-Upload the **POD document** by either:
     Scanning it using the **device camera**, or
     Selecting a file from the **device storage**.

-Tap the **UPLOAD DOCUMENTS** button to submit the POD.

### 🛠 Troubleshooting & Tips

-If the link doesn’t open, **check internet connectivity** or try using a different browser.

-If the OTP isn’t received, confirm the **driver’s WhatsApp number** and retry.

-For best results, use updated browsers like **Chrome or Safari**.
