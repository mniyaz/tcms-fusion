## 🗒️ Additional Information

**Booking Movement:** After a booking is cancelled, it will always move to the **SUMMARY** tab, either without invoicing (for non-chargeable cancellations) or with invoicing (for chargeable cancellations).

**Cancellation Options:** Only bookings that are marked as **"Chargeable"** can have an associated cancellation fee; non-chargeable bookings are typically not subject to any fees.
