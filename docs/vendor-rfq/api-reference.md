# API & code documentation (moved)

API and code documentation for the Vendor RFQ module has been moved to a **separate developer section** so end users can focus on how to use the feature, and developers can find all technical details in one place.

## Where to go

- **[Developer documentation](/developers/intro)** – Start here for API and code docs.
- **[API reference](/developers/api-reference)** – All REST endpoints: paths, methods, request/response, authentication.
- **[Code overview](/developers/code-overview)** – Routes, components, file locations, state, and where each API is used.

You can also open **For developers** in the sidebar to see the full list.
