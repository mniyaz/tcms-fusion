# Using the RFQ Dashboard

This page explains how to use the **RFQ Dashboard** as a planner: create an RFQ, send it to vendors, view quotes, cancel an RFQ, accept a quote, and complete the assignment.

**Where to open it:** Sidebar → **Operations** → **RFQ Dashboard**.

---

## Creating an RFQ

1. In the **Create RFQ** section, use the **booking list** to select the booking you want to get quotes for.  
   - Only bookings that are **Booked** or **Redelivery** and that **do not already have an RFQ** appear in the list.
2. Choose the **expiry date**—the last date and time when vendors can submit a quote.
3. Click **Create RFQ**.  
   - The system creates the RFQ and shows it under **Active RFQs**.  
   - You can only have **one RFQ per booking**; if a booking already has an RFQ, it won’t appear in the create list.

---

## Viewing active RFQs

In **Active RFQs** you see each RFQ with:

- RFQ ID and booking reference  
- Customer name  
- Status: **Open**, **Closed**, **Cancelled**, or **Expired**  
- Expiry date  
- Truck requirement and route (e.g. pickup city → delivery city)  
- Number of quotes received  

**Expand** a row to see:

- **Booking details** – Full pickup and delivery addresses and dates, and truck requirement.  
- **Quotes** – Each quote with vendor name, quoted amount, truck, and driver. From here you can **Accept** the quote you want.

---

## Sending the RFQ to vendors

You can send the vendor link in three ways:

### 1. Copy link

- Use **Copy link** on the RFQ row.  
- The full link is copied so you can paste it into any chat, email, or message.  
- Vendors open this link to see the job and submit their quote (no login).

### 2. Share via WhatsApp (generic)

- Use the **WhatsApp** icon to open WhatsApp with a **pre-written message** that includes the job summary and the link.  
- You can send this to anyone; the link is the same for all.  
- Use this when you don’t need to pre-identify the vendor in the link.

### 3. Send to selected vendors

- Click **“Send to selected vendors”**.  
- A list of **vendors** (from your system) appears. Select the vendors you want to invite.  
- Click **“Send to N vendors via WhatsApp”**.  
- WhatsApp opens **for each selected vendor** with:  
  - A **personalized message** (job summary, pickup/delivery, truck requirement), and  
  - A **link that includes that vendor’s details**.  
- When that vendor opens **their** link, they will see **“Submitting as: [Vendor name]”** and can use **truck and driver suggestions** from their own fleet (or type manually).  
- This is the best option when you want each vendor to get their own link and see their name on the form.

---

## Cancelling an RFQ

- On an **Open** RFQ, use the **cancel (X)** icon.  
- Confirm with **“Yes, cancel”** or **“No”**.  
- After cancellation, the RFQ status becomes **Cancelled** and the vendor link will no longer accept new quotes.

---

## Accepting a quote and going to Quick Assign

1. **Expand** the RFQ and find the quote you want to accept.  
2. Click **Accept** on that quote.  
3. When the message appears: **“Assign this booking to this vendor? You will be redirected to Quick Assign to complete the assignment.”**  
   - Click **Yes** if you want to assign now.  
4. You are taken to the **Planning (Quick Assign)** page with:  
   - **Vendor** and **Vendor ID**  
   - **Truck** (from the quote)  
   - **Driver** and **Driver phone**  
   - **Tonnage** (from the quote)  
   - **Agreed price** (quoted amount)  
5. Check the details and click **Confirm & Assign** to complete the assignment. You can change any field before confirming if needed.

---

## RFQ History

- From the RFQ Dashboard, click **History** to open the **RFQ History** page.  
- There you can **filter** by status, booking reference, vendor, and date range, and **export** the list (e.g. to CSV).  
- Use **“Back to RFQ Dashboard”** to return to the main dashboard.
