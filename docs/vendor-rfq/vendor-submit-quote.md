# Submitting a quote (for vendors)

This page is for **vendors** who receive an RFQ link (e.g. by WhatsApp) and need to submit their quote. You do **not** need to log in or have an account—you only need the link sent by the planner.

---

## What you need

- The **link** sent to you (e.g. in a WhatsApp message from the planner).  
- The link opens a **single page** where you can see the job details and submit your quote.

---

## What you will see

When you open the link, the page shows:

1. **Job details**  
   - Booking reference  
   - **Pickup** – Address and date/time  
   - **Delivery** – Address and date/time  
   - **Truck required** – Type, tonnage, and quantity  
   - **Goods** – Description of what is to be carried  

2. **Your identity (if the link was sent specifically to you)**  
   - At the top you may see **“Submitting as: [Your company name]”**.  
   - This means the link was generated for you. In that case, you may also get **suggestions** for your trucks and drivers when you fill the form (see below).

3. **Submit your quote**  
   - A form where you enter:  
     - **Quoted amount (RM)** – Your price in Malaysian Ringgit  
     - **Truck number** – The truck you will use  
     - **Tonnage** – Select from the list (e.g. 3 Ton, 5 Ton)  
     - **Driver name** – Name of the driver  
     - **Driver phone** – Driver’s contact number  

---

## How to fill the form

- **Quoted amount (RM)** – Enter your price. This is required.  
- **Truck number** – Enter the truck registration/number.  
  - If your link shows “Submitting as: [Your name],” you may see **suggestions** as you type (from your registered trucks). You can **choose one** or **type any** truck number.  
- **Tonnage** – Choose the correct tonnage from the **dropdown** (e.g. 5 Ton).  
- **Driver name** – Enter the driver’s name.  
  - If you have suggestions, you can **select a driver** from the list; their **phone number** may be filled in automatically. You can also **type** the name and phone yourself.  
- **Driver phone** – Enter the driver’s contact number (optional but useful).

When everything is correct, click **Submit quote**.

---

## After you submit

- You will see a **success message** if the quote was submitted correctly.  
- The form may clear so you could submit again only if the planner has left the RFQ open for more quotes; normally one quote per vendor is enough.  
- The planner will see your quote on their RFQ Dashboard and may **accept** it and assign the job to you.

## Tips

- Use the **exact link** you received. If the planner sent it via “Send to selected vendors,” your link includes your company details so the form shows your name and can suggest your trucks and drivers.  
- If you don’t see suggestions, you can still type **truck number**, **driver name**, and **driver phone** manually—the form works either way.  
- Make sure the **quoted amount**, **truck number**, and **driver name** are filled in; the rest helps the planner contact the driver and match the job.
