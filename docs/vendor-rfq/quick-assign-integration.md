# Completing the assignment after accepting a quote

After you **accept a quote** on the RFQ Dashboard, you can complete the assignment on the **Quick Assign** (Planning) page. The system **pre-fills** the winning vendor’s details so you only need to confirm and assign.

---

## When does this happen?

1. On the **RFQ Dashboard**, you expand an RFQ and click **Accept** on the quote you want.  
2. A message asks: **“Assign this booking to this vendor? You will be redirected to Quick Assign to complete the assignment.”**  
3. You click **Yes**.  
4. You are taken to the **Planning** page (Quick Assign) with the **Vendor** option selected and the form already filled with the accepted quote’s details.

## What is pre-filled?

When you land on Quick Assign after accepting a quote, these fields are already filled:

| Field          | What you see                                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Vendor         | The accepted vendor’s name                        |
| Vendor ID      | The vendor’s ID (set automatically)              |
| Truck          | Truck number from the quote                       |
| Driver         | Driver name from the quote                        |
| Driver phone   | Driver phone from the quote                       |
| Tonnage        | The tonnage from the quote (matched to the list)  |
| Agreed price   | The quoted amount                                 |

The **booking** (pickup, delivery, etc.) is also loaded so the assignment is for the correct job.

## What you need to do

1. **Check** the pre-filled details. You can change any field if needed.  
2. If you use **Send Mail**, leave the checkbox as you want it.  
3. Click **Confirm & Assign** to complete the assignment.  
4. After a successful assignment, a **success message** appears and **Print** buttons (e.g. Manifest, GD, DO) may appear. If the panel is long, **scroll down** inside the right-hand panel to reach the print buttons.

## Why use this flow?

- You don’t have to **re-type** vendor, truck, driver, tonnage, or price.  
- The **tonnage** from the vendor’s quote is matched to the correct option in the list so the assignment is consistent.  
- You go from **“Accept quote”** to **“Assignment done”** in a few clicks.

If you prefer not to assign immediately, you can click **No** when asked to go to Quick Assign. You can still assign the booking to that vendor later from the Planning page by selecting the vendor and entering the details manually.
